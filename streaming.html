	<p>I love to watch all different kinds of shows on Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, Amazon Prime, you name it. My favorites to watch are usually reality tv or competition shows. They always keep me entertained for hours. <br>
	Below are some of my favorite shows that I'm enjoying right now!</p>

		<h3>Netflix</h3>

		<p><strong>Love is Blind: Season 2</strong> <br>
		This is one of my favorite shows right now because I love reality TV and I think it's entertaining. The way the people interact after meeting face-to-face for the first time makes me cringe, but I can't look away! Their journeys from the pods to their weddings just weeks later keeps me interested in who will end up together and who will leave at the altar. I definitely recommend!</p>

		<h3>HBO Max</h3>

		<p><strong>Barry</strong> <br>
		I am a little late to watch Barry, as it came out in 2018, but it's become one of my favorite shows! Bill Hader as a hired assassin turned actor in the show is really great. The show is funny, dramatic, and a little ridiculous, which keeps me watching. Season 3 comes out soon so I caught up just in time! </p>
