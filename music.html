	<p>I listen to music every single day, and I love finding new music and artists to enjoy. I typically listen to pop, R&B, and female rappers, but I love everything that isn't country ;)</p>

		<p><strong>MONTERO</strong><br>
			<i>by Lil Nas X</i> <br>
			His first album has some of my favorite songs on it! They range from pop, to rap, to even some slower, sentimental songs. Something for everyone! <br>
			<i> Notable songs from the album: </i> </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Scoop ft. Doja Cat</li>

		<p><strong>No Love</strong> <br>
			<i>by Summer Walker ft. SZA</i> <br>
			This song is about finding your worth after giving all you had in a bad relationship, and then using it to your advantage. I think the beat and rhythm of this song make it so addicting. I also love Summer Walker and SZA, so together any song they make is going to be one of my favorites. </p>
